Bow and Arrow Rig v1.0 by Josh Underwood

NOTES:

This is a simple bow rig that I created for use with archery-related animation.

The rig uses a combination of FK and IK joints that work simultaneously. Multiple sets of 
IK chains are used in coordination with each other to create a smooth bend in the body
of the bow while the bowstring is being pulled back, and a set of FK joints is used to
allow for changing the point at which the hand is gripping the string.

The rig is free to use, and while I'm never going to hunt anybody down, I do request that you
give appropriate credit if you use it in a shot and post it online.

HOW TO USE THE BOW:

There are 3 controls on the bow that should allow for any motion you would want for
the vast majority of bow-related animation.

bowMasterCtrl: the large white control in front of the bow is how you control the 
translation, rotation, and global scale of the bow. The control pivots around the center of 
the bow's handle, so this control is what you want to constrain to your character's hand.

drawCtrl: This control pulls the bowstring back and causes the body of the bow to bend.
It only moves in the local X direction.

stringSlideCtrl: This is the dark green control found within the drawCtrl. Use it to 
manipulate the string without bending the bow. It can move in every direction and rotate
on the X and Z axes.

HOW TO USE THE ARROW:

arrowMasterCtrl: The red control above the arrow can be used to translate and rotate the arrow 
as well as scale it. This is what you want to use to control the arrow's flight path and what 
you want to constrain to.

arrowTwistCtrl: The control inside arrowMasterCtrl features limited rotation pivoted at the tip 
of the arrow head. The Twist attribute is just what it sounds like. The Bend attributes use 
deformers to allow the arrow to be warped for realistic, slow motion animation. The Stuck 
attributes are also bend deformers that pivot at the tip of the arrow (for a cartoony effect when 
the arrow gets stuck in a target).

Lastly, a helpful tip: DO NOT DUPLICATE THE ARROW WITHIN A SCENE. The bend deformers will not
work on the duplicated arrow. Either import or reference another arrow if you need more than one.
